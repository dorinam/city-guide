			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>Tokyo was named the world's most satisfying city for travel in a 2013.</p>
			<p>There are countless independent fashion boutiques in the Harajuku area -- all dedicated to generally insane forms of youth fashion. If you count adjacent Shibuya, Omotesando and Aoyama into the region, you have the world's largest fashion district: featuring basically every single major designer brand in the world.</p>
			<p>Edo-Tokyo Museum is the best place to relive the old traditional style of life in Tokyo, when it was called Edo in the 15th to 19th centuries. </p>

			<p>You could spend hours drooling over the elaborate pastries and picture-perfect sushi rolls at department store Isetan's super-stylish depachika, a massive basement food court. Square watermelons and matsutake mushrooms are displayed with gallery-like reverence.</p>

			<h2>How to get here</h2>
			<p><strong>By Plane: </strong>Tokyo has two airports: Narita Airport handles the majority of international flights and only a small number of domestic flights. It is located 60 kilometers outside of central Tokyo. The more centrally located Haneda Airport handles a smaller number of international flights and the majority of domestic flights.</p>
			<p><strong>By Shinkansen: </strong>Most shinkansen lines lead to Tokyo. The trip from Osaka/Kyoto takes about three hours. There are also direct trains to/from Kyushu, Kanazawa, Niigata and various destinations in the Tohoku Region and Hokkaido.</p>
